                        This was my internship. Here mi job was to maintain the
                        infrastructure and solve problems with the workstations.
                        One of the bigger challenges was to join three separate
                        networks within the institution.

                        I started as a software analyst in charge of supporting
                        many systems and processes. After this stage I moved on
                        to be a developer. Here I worked with many Microsoft
                        Technologies including vbscript, asp.net, vb.net, c#.net
                        and many other non development tools like Reporting
                        Services and Analysis Services.

                        I also work as a Developer, working with technologies 
                        like vb.net, c#.net and others.

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
                In the near future I would like to branch out and professionally
                develop in other technologies outside the Microsoft spectrum.
                I really prefer the open source world, mainly Python, Ruby and
                now Go.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the long term Id like to create my own startup with some
                projects I have laid out. Im actively working on them but they've
                not yet come to fruition.
